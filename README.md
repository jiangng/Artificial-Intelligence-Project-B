# Artificial-Intelligence-Project-B

This is the second groupwork project I did when taking the 3rd-year subject Artificial Intelligence at The University of Melbourne. This project was based on a board game invented by the head tutor known as Watch Your Back. Our task was to design and implement a Python program to play a complete game of Watch Your Back. The main difficulty we faced was to ensure our program finish running within the time limit (one minute) while maintaining the AI performance. Although our AI program only passed Level 2 out of 4 levels, we still attained a satisfactory score, 17.75 out of 22 marks, as we scored well in the creativity criterion.
